[12:02:08] Content: Cross-region deployment for high availability involves deploying applications and data across multiple geographic regions, providing redundancy and resilience against regional failures or outages. This approach ensures that if one region experiences an issue, the application can continue running in another region, minimizing downtime and maintaining service availability for users across different locations.

[12:02:11] Content: Failover mechanisms in distributed systems are crucial for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. They enable the system to automatically switch over to a redundant or standby component, server, or node in case of a failure, preventing downtime and maintaining the continuity of services.
