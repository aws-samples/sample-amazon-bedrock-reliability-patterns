[21:58:06] Starting non-cached inference tests
[21:58:06] Testing without caching - Question: What are the key principles mentioned?
[21:58:09] Non-cached inference successful: 2.75s
[21:58:09] Token usage: {
  "inputTokens": 127,
  "outputTokens": 183,
  "totalTokens": 310
}
[21:58:09] Response: The key principles mentioned in the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework for AI (AWS CAF for AI) are:

1. **Start with business outcomes and work backwards**:
   - Begin by identifying the desired business outcomes and then design AI strategies to achieve those goals.

2. **Build a data-driven culture and capabilities**:
   - Foster a culture that values data-driven decision-making and invest in the capabilities needed to effectively utilize data for AI.

3. **Implement responsible AI practices**:
   - Ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a manner that is ethical, transparent, and accountable.

4. **Establish governance and risk management**:
   - Create governance frameworks and risk management strategies to oversee AI initiatives and mitigate potential risks.

5. **Invest in talent and change management**:
   - Develop the necessary talent and implement change management practices to support the adoption and scaling of AI within the organization.
[21:58:09] Testing without caching - Question: How many perspectives does the framework cover?
[21:58:11] Non-cached inference successful: 1.97s
[21:58:11] Token usage: {
  "inputTokens": 128,
  "outputTokens": 144,
  "totalTokens": 272
}
[21:58:11] Response: The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework for AI (AWS CAF for AI) covers six perspectives. These perspectives are:

1. **Business**: Focuses on aligning AI initiatives with business outcomes and strategies.
2. **People**: Emphasizes building a data-driven culture, developing talent, and managing change.
3. **Governance**: Addresses the establishment of governance frameworks and responsible AI practices.
4. **Platform**: Covers the technical infrastructure and capabilities needed to support AI workloads.
5. **Security**: Focuses on implementing security measures to protect AI systems and data.
6. **Operations**: Addresses the operational practices required to maintain and scale AI solutions.

Each of these perspectives provides specific guidance to help organizations adopt AI capabilities effectively and at scale.
