[12:03:30] Content: Cross-region deployment for high availability involves deploying your application across multiple geographic regions, ensuring that if one region experiences an outage or disruption, the application remains available and accessible from other regions. This approach mitigates the risk of a single point of failure and provides a higher level of fault tolerance, allowing your application to continue operating seamlessly even in the face of regional disruptions.
